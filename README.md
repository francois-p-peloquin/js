# js

These scraps come from a number of projects that I have doone in the past, libraries I developed myself for reuse. Some of them are simple hook and reuse, some of them work in conjunction with each other. For example, in home.js, at the bottom of the page after the new object is initiated, the objects from files edit_tabs.js and add_item.js have been called in. Those two items recur in being called in, as they were used many times across the websites.

# objects

The main objects to consider are edit_tabs.js, add_item.js, search.js. These objects are accessed by other objects in the code base. 

# scraps

There are many useful jQuery hooks and simple scraps of code in the script.js file, which is sort of my dumping ground for simple standalone functions.
